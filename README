NAME
    Net::Amazon::Signature::V4 - Implements the Amazon Web Services
    signature version 4, AWS4-HMAC-SHA256

VERSION
    Version 0.19

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Amazon::Signature::V4;

        my $sig = Net::Amazon::Signature::V4->new( $access_key_id, $secret, $endpoint, $service );
        my $req = HTTP::Request->parse( $request_string );
        my $signed_req = $sig->sign( $req );
        ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module signs an HTTP::Request to Amazon Web Services by appending
    an Authorization header. Amazon Web Services signature version 4,
    AWS4-HMAC-SHA256, is used.

    The primary purpose of this module is to be used by
    Net::Amazon::Glacier.

METHODS
  new
        my $sig = Net::Amazon::Signature::V4->new( $access_key_id, $secret, $endpoint, $service );
        my $sig = Net::Amazon::Signature::V4->new({
            access_key_id => $access_key_id,
            secret        => $secret,
            endpoint      => $endpoint,
            service       => $service,
        });

    Constructs the signature object, which is used to sign requests.

    Note that the access key ID is an alphanumeric string, not your account
    ID. The endpoint could be "eu-west-1", and the service could be
    "glacier".

    Since version 0.20, parameters can be passed in a hashref. The keys
    "access_key_id", "secret", "endpoint", and "service" are required.
    "security_token", if passed, will be applied to each signed request as
    the "X-Amz-Security-Token" header.

  sign
        my $signed_request = $sig->sign( $request );

    Signs a request with your credentials by appending the Authorization
    header. $request should be an HTTP::Request. The signed request is
    returned.
